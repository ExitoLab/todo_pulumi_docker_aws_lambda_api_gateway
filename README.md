# Building and Deploying a Serverless Todo App on AWS with Docker, Lambda, API Gateway, and GitHub Actions using Pulumi in Python

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to build and deploy a serverless Todo application on AWS using Docker, AWS Lambda, API Gateway, and GitHub Actions. We use Pulumi, an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool, to automate the provisioning and deployment of AWS resources in Python.

### Features
- **Dockerized Lambda function**: The application code is packaged into a Docker container.
- **Serverless**: AWS Lambda handles business logic, while API Gateway exposes HTTP endpoints.
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions automates the deployment process.
- **Pulumi**: Infrastructure provisioning with Pulumi in Python.
